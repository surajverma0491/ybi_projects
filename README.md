🏗️ REGRESSION MODEL TO PREDICT CEMENT COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH--------------------------------------------

📜 Overview
This project aims to develop a regression model to predict the compressive strength of cement based on various input features, including
ingredient proportions and curing age. Predicting compressive strength is essential in the construction industry to ensure the quality and durability of concrete structures.
The project leverages machine learning techniques, specifically regression models, to make accurate predictions of cement compressive strength. 
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes data on the composition and curing age of concrete samples.

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information on cement mixes and their respective compressive strengths. Key features include:

CEMENT (kg per m³): The amount of cement in the mix.
BLAST FURNACE SLAG (kg per m³): The amount of blast furnace slag.
FLY ASH (kg per m³): The amount of fly ash.
WATER (kg per m³): The amount of water.
SUPERPLASTICIZER (kg per m³): The amount of superplasticizer.
COARSE AGGREGATE (kg per m³): The amount of coarse aggregate.
FINE AGGREGATE (kg per m³): The amount of fine aggregate.
AGE (days): The age of the sample.
COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH (MPa): The target variable, representing the strength of the cement.

📂 Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset files and any preprocessed versions.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development.
src/: Scripts used for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
